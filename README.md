# pgm-image-processing

It was a college project where we had to implement a simple image erosion and dilation on an array of 1's and 0's.
But after I finished the project I decided I would push it one step further and so I created a PGM to ASCII converter that also includes erosion and dilation (it produces
a few results).

## Results
